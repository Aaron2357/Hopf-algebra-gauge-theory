# Hopf-algebra-gauge-theory
In this repository we give codes for computing the algebra of functions and representations of the algebra of functions for Hopf algebra gauge theory. 
This code is used in our publication: https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/acdf9a 
We study the  connection between this framework and quantum double models abstractly and for some specific examples. 
Special attention is dedicated to the gauge theory constructed with a Zn, the finite cyclic group of integers as gauge group, but furnished with a non-trivial R matrix.
